### Python, Data, Machine Learning, Raspberry Pi, and Distractions

#### About
My name is Mike Moran and this is a repository of my code snippets and projects I'm working on.

#### What is this?
This website is created using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/JupyterSite). It's content without the fuss. Sure, it may not look great on your mobile device, but it's useful for conveying thoughts and code. For any long-form writing, I'll post [here](https://medium.com/@distracteddata).
